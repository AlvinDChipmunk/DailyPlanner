# Basic Daily Work Planner

This is supposed to be a work planner that displays one hour blocks of a typical work day, 9 AM to 5 PM.  

## Instructions

Interactivity comes with the central column consisting of green text fields one can edit for future appointments, and red and grey text fields that show either current hour appointment as red, or past appointments as grey.  

There is a button to the right of each hour that shows either a locked or unlocked icon.  Pressing on the buttons with unlocked icons save the appointment typed in to local storage. 

### Notes 

19 Oct 2019, 7:41 PM - Currently the underlying data structure relies on parallel arrays.  Javascript objects in the script file cannot seem to be properly referenced??  Also, saving appointment data currently not working.    

22 Oct 2019, 4:35 PM - Last upload of index.html finally got the save appointment data function to work!!
